              <p>
                &emsp;My Dad was my mentor who taught me a lot about technology. All my life, he was always there, ready to teach, correct, and do things with me. Then one day he wasn&rsquo;t. 
              </p>
              <p>
                &emsp;Dad went into sudden cardiac arrest around 12 am the day after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day of last year. All I remember is waking up, glancing at my clock, and stumbling out of bed to find Mom and a crew of firefighters standing in the hallway.  A close family friend who arrived to help ushered my 3 brothers and I into the family room. Then Mom left to follow the ambulance to the hospital. I don&rsquo;t remember how I knew, just that I did, that my Dad wouldn&#39;t ever be the same again. 
              </p>
              <p>
                &emsp;The following months were about the same. Mom at the hospital with Dad and caregivers with us every day for the first two months. Then one day the hospital just sent Dad home, wheelchair and everything. Not much changed, other than Mom being extremely tired, as now the hospital expected Mom to drive Dad to neuro rehab and doctor&rsquo;s appointments every day from May through August of 2022. Gradually, as the weeks went by, Mom was home more, and Dad as well. As he was home more and more, everyone had a hard time relearning how to relate to him. 
              </p>
              <p>
                &emsp;Even though the experience was and still is painful, I have learned and grown a lot this year. Looking back on the few months where neither Mom nor Dad were home, I would say that I became very independent, especially in how and what I learned. During those few months, I taught myself 11 different programming languages and 8/9th grade math. Using those programming skills, I coped with all the huge changes in my life by working on my smart room. Between coding and painting with acrylics, I still completed my schoolwork even with no external source to make sure it was getting done. 
              </p>
              <p>
                &emsp;Now, a little more than a year later, I&rsquo;m re-teaching Dad what he taught me: How our home network is set up; how to use his tools; and how to ride his bike, among other things. In the past few months, I&rsquo;ve even stepped into some of the roles Dad used to have. I&rsquo;ve run the home network, installed new things around the house, and gotten my two youngest brothers ready for bed, all of which are things my Dad used to do. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility, so I have gotten more responsible over the course of the past year. While I was heartbroken when I heard that I wouldn&rsquo;t have the same dad I was used to, I am choosing to see the numerous good things that have come from the experience.
