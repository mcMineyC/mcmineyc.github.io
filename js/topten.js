"Coding is unquestionably one of my passions.  As you can see on my Youtube channel, I've written this entire website.  I also wrote an online gallery website for my art class, so that people who couldn't make it to an in-person exhibit could still show off their art.",
"Making 3D animations  allows me to do things I wouldn't normally be able to do, such as making a computer explode, or knocking down half a million dominoes (literally).",
"Yes, I do like playing video games. I don't, however, like playing mind-numbing first-person shooters.  Instead, I like games that have a puzzle in them such as Portal 2 and Superliminal.  I also like creating modern houses and cities in Minecraft.",
"Reading transports me into another world and helps me relax.  That's really all there is to say.",

"I'm interested in science because it basically explains how the world works.  As someone who wants to know how things work and why they work that way, science helps me in my pursuit of knowledge.",
"Math.  Some kids hate it, some don't mind it.  Personally, I think it's been extremely helpful in science, as you can calculate the mass of an object, determine the half-life of a radioactive substance, and ",
